# Starbucks Capstone Challenge
How Consumers Behave On The Starbucks Reward App

# Description:
This notebook is done as the capstone project for Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree. As a means to attract and retain customers, once every few days Starbucks provides a rewards program that honors regular customers with special offers not available to the standard customer. A customer who received the offer would be rewarded when his cumulated consumption over the designed threshold.

# Problem Statement:
The problem we are looking to solve here is to build a recommendation engine that recommends Starbucks which offer should be sent to a particular customer based on their purchasing decisions.

# Dataset:
The dataset is based on simulated data of consumer behaviour on the Starbucks rewards mobile application provided by Starbucks and Udacity and given in the form of three JSON files.
